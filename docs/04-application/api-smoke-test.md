# API smoke test boundary

This API layer can support smoke tests without calling a real LLM when the test stays inside startup, health, and event-read boundaries.

## Safe paths

- Import `createApiServer`, `startApiServer`, and `stopApiServer` from `apps/persona/src/interface/api/server.ts`.
- Bind to port `0` or a test-specific port through `startApiServer({ port: 0 })`.
- Call `GET /health` to verify process and database counters.
- Call `GET /api/events` to verify read-side routing.
- Close the returned server with `stopApiServer(server)` or `server.close()`.

## Main runtime boundary

`apps/persona/src/main/index.ts` still auto-starts by default for normal application use. Smoke tests that only want to import the main module can set:

```bash
PERSONA_MAIN_AUTOSTART=0
```

Tests that need the real startup path can call `startPersonaRuntime({ api: { port: 0 }, telegram: false })` and then `runtime.stop()`.

For normal local Workspace use, the Companion chat panel expects the Application API at `http://127.0.0.1:3001`, with `GET /health` for status and `POST /api/chat` for chat messages.

## LLM boundary

`POST /api/chat` calls the conversation flow. With the default LLM provider this can reach the real DeepSeek API. Use one of these options for a no-real-LLM smoke test:

- Do not call `POST /api/chat`; test only `/health` and `/api/events`.
- Set `LLM_PROVIDER=mock` before calling `/api/chat`.

Do not depend on missing API keys to block a real network call. The explicit mock provider is the safer test contract.

## Current command

Run the full no-real-LLM HTTP smoke test from the repository root:

```bash
npm.cmd run smoke:api
```

The command starts the API on `127.0.0.1:3101`, posts to `/api/chat`, verifies the mock reply, waits for the asynchronous Memory patch, deletes its smoke rows, and closes the server.
